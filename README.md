# Azure Icons Explorations

My collection of Azure-related icon mining and service descriptions

## What is this?

In July of 2024 I began to scour every place I could find to try and decode the various Azure Services available as related to the SVG icon that maps to the capability.

## How do I use this?

1. The file `AzureServicesIconsData.json` contains a variety of information that can be used to get going quickly. It's broken into categories and subcategories. The file sources icons that are in the `AzureServicesIcons` directory.

2. The file `WebIconsData.json` has another approach I used to figure out mappings to SVG. I think I did it in a way that was super messy. It's how I first got started. The file sources icons that are in the `WebIconsData` directory.

3. The file `gcpvsazurecomparison.md` uses the information [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/gcp-professional/services) to get more definitions on how the Azure components work. In the future I want to take a look at [this list](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started/aws-azure-gcp-service-comparison) on GCP that compares services to AWS' offerings.
